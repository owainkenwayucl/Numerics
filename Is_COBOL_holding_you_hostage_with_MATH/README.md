[Is COBOL holding you hostage with Math?](https://medium.com/the-technical-archaeologist/is-cobol-holding-you-hostage-with-math-5498c0eb428b)

I would strongly recommend her book [Kill it with Fire](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kill-Fire-Manage-Computer-Systems-ebook/dp/B08CTFY4JP/) - it's a really informative and entertaining read for anyone who has to maintain or moderinise large systems.
